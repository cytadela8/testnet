%proofs is for this
%If the attacker sends a valid block with a valid header,
% but makes one of the proofs of the state tree wrong.
%The node getting attacked would have to verify all the proofs until it found a bad one.
%I think this might be making it too affordable to DDOS our nodes.
%So I am thinking of adding something more to the header.
%A hash of a datastructure containing all the proofs for this block.
%So when you are loading the block,
%you can know if a proof has been manipulated immediately.
